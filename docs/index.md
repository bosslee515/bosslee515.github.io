## About me

 **Qin Li**¬†(**ÊùéÁß¶**) is a master degree student in [the School of Landscape Architecture](https://solaold.bjfu.edu.cn/english/) at¬†[Beijing Forestry University](https://english.bjfu.edu.cn/) under the guidance of [Professor Xiaodong Zheng](https://sola.bjfu.edu.cn/cn/teachers/office/js/388443.html), drawing upon her multidisciplinary background in Landscape Architecture, Architecture and Geography. She is also a research assistant in [USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences](https://dornsife.usc.edu/) working with [Professor¬†Siqin(Sisi) Wang](https://dornsife.usc.edu/spatial/profile/siqin-sisi-wang/), as an Intern in the¬†[Spatial Data Lab](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/chinadatalab)¬†(SDL) internship program in Harvard University. Additionally, Her work has been published in peer-reviewed journals, including¬†_Sustainability_ and _Urbanism and Architecture_.

Beyond academia, she has extensive practical experience in landscape architecture design, architecture design and environmental planning. She has completed two internships in Beijing Tsinghua Tongheng Planning and Design Institute Limited ‚Äì [Deot. of Sustainable City Planning](http://dscp.thupdi.com/) (2022-2024) and Architectural Design & Research Institute of Tsinghua University [(THAD)](https://www.thad.com.cn/) ‚Äì Department of Architectural Programming and Design (2024). 

As a graduate student, she contributed to the program _Planning and Design of Mufu Mountain Scenic Area (Hunan, China)_ (2022-2035)¬†in [China Academy of Urban Planning & Design](https://www.caupd.com/index.html)under the guidance of [Professor Wei Duan](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2305-4779) and ¬†collaborated with [School of Architecture](https://www.arch.tsinghua.edu.cn/column/Home), Tsinghua University in _SUSTAINABLE FUTURE CHALLENGE (SFC)_ supervised by [Prof. Wei Duan](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2305-4779) and [Prof. Ning Zhu](https://www.arch.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/rw_jzx/1404)  

This experience significantly enhanced her spatial analysis and teamwork skills, while also enriching her practical experience and professional expertise in human settlements. Through in-depth research from a micro-level perspective, she gained a profound understanding of the intricacies and complexities of human habitats. This foundation has provided her with a multidimensional framework for subsequent research in geography and urban-rural planning from a macro-level perspective. The integration of micro and macro perspectives enables her to analyze issues more comprehensively and propose innovative, practical solutions in her academic pursuits.
